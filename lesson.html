                <h2> History and Evolution</h2>
                ITC was incorporated on August 24, 1910 under the name Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited. As the Company's ownership progressively
                 Indianised, √çthe name of the Company was changed from Imperial Tobacco Company of India Limited to India Tobacco Company Limited in 1970 and 
                 then to I.T.C. Limited in 1974. In recognition of the Company's multi-business portfolio encompassing a wide range of businesses - Fast Moving 
                 Consumer Goods comprising Foods, Personal Care, Cigarettes and Cigars, Branded Apparel, Education and Stationery Products, Incense Sticks and 
                 Safety Matches, Hotels, Paperboards & Specialty Papers, Packaging, Agri-Business and Information Technology - the full stops in the Company's 
                 name were removed effective September 18, 2001. The Company now stands rechristened 'ITC Limited,' where 'ITC' is today no longer an acronym or 
                 an initialised form.
                
                <h2>A Modest Beginning</h2>
                The Company's beginnings were humble. A leased office on Radha Bazar Lane, Kolkata, was the centre of the Company's existence. 
                The Company celebrated its 16th birthday on August 24, 1926, by purchasing the plot of land situated at 37, Chowringhee, (now renamed J.L. 
                Nehru Road) Kolkata, for the sum of Rs 310,000. This decision of the Company was historic in more ways than one. It was to mark the beginning of 
                a long and eventful journey into India's future. The Company's headquarter building, 'Virginia House', which came up on that plot of land two years
                 later, would go on to become one of Kolkata's most venerated landmarks.
                 <b>1925:</b>Packaging and Printing: Backward Integration
                 Though the first six decades of the Company's existence were primarily devoted to the growth and consolidation of the Cigarettes and Leaf Tobacco
                  businesses, ITC's Packaging & Printing Business was set up in 1925 as a strategic backward integration for ITC's Cigarettes business. It is today
                   India's most sophisticated packaging house.<a href="#l2">lesson 2</a>

                 <b>1975:</b> Entry into the Hospitality Sector - A 'Welcom' Move
                 The Seventies witnessed the beginnings of a corporate transformation that would usher in momentous changes in the life of the Company. In 1975, the Company 
                 launched its Hotels business with the acquisition of a hotel in Chennai which was rechristened 'ITC-Welcomgroup Hotel Chola' (now renamed My Fortune, Chennai). The objective of ITC's entry into the hotels business was rooted in the concept of creating value for the nation. ITC chose the Hotels business for its potential to earn high levels of foreign exchange, create tourism infrastructure and generate large scale direct and indirect employment. Since then ITC's Hotels business has grown to occupy a position of leadership, with over 100 owned and managed properties spread across India under four brands namely, ITC Hotels - Luxury Collection, WelcomHotels, Fortune Hotels and WelcomHeritage.
                 
                 ITC Hotels recently took its first step toward international expansion with an upcoming super premium luxury hotel in Colombo, Sri Lanka. In addition, 
                 ITC Hotels also recently tied up with RP Group Hotels & Resorts to manage 5 hotels in Dubai and India under ITC Hotels' 5-star 'WelcomHotel' brand and the
                  mid-market to upscale 'Fortune' brand.

                 <b>1979:</b>Paperboards & Specialty Papers - Development of a Backward Area
                 In 1979, ITC entered the Paperboards business by promoting ITC Bhadrachalam Paperboards Limited. Bhadrachalam Paperboards amalgamated with the Company 
                 effective March 13, 2002 and became a Division of the Company, Bhadrachalam Paperboards Division. In November 2002, this division merged with the Company's 
                 Tribeni Tissues Division to form the Paperboards & Specialty Papers Division. ITC's paperboards' technology, productivity, quality and manufacturing processes
                  are comparable to the best in the world. It has also made an immense contribution to the development of Sarapaka, an economically backward area in the state 
                  of Andhra Pradesh. It is directly involved in education, environmental protection and community development. In 2004, ITC acquired the paperboard 
                  manufacturing facility of BILT Industrial Packaging Co. Ltd (BIPCO), near Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. The Kovai Unit allows ITC to improve customer service with 
                  reduced lead time and a wider product range.

                 The merged entity was named the Tribeni Tissues Division (TTD). To harness strategic and operational synergies, TTD was merged with the Bhadrachalam 
                 Paperboards Division to form the Paperboards & Specialty Papers Division in November 2002.

                 Also in 1990, leveraging its agri-sourcing competency, ITC set up the Agri Business Division for export of agri-commodities. The Division is today one of 
                 India's largest exporters. ITC's unique and now widely acknowledged e-Choupal initiative began in 2000 with soya farmers in Madhya Pradesh. Now it extends to 
                 10 states covering over 4 million farmers. Also, through the 'Choupal Pradarshan Khet' initiative, the agri services vertical has been focusing on improving 
                 productivity of crops while deepening the relationship with the farming community.
